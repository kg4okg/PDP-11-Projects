M9312 Bootstrap/Console/Terminator PROM Tools
---------------------------------------------

These tools were used to generate the M9312 IntelHEX PROM image files from
sources generated by disassembling device image files.

The following tools are included:

o macro11.exe - MACRO-11 compatible assembler, obtained from
    <http://simh.trailing-edge.com/sources/simtools.zip>
  This particular image was recompiled to run in the CYGWIN environment.

o dumpobj.exe - MACRO-11 object .obj file dumper, same source as above.
  This tool is not actually required but is useful for debugging problems.

o diffrom.pl - a perl script to compare two PROM files (HEX or BINARY)
  for equality; prints differing bytes. Also computes simple checksum.

o obj2hex.pl - a perl script that processes a MACRO-11 .obj file, producing
  various other useful forms (Intel HEX, DEC binary, papertape format). I
  use this program for building boot and console PROM images, and it can be
  used to process MACRO-11 programs for loading/running under SIMH and on
  real hardware under XXDP.

o enet2hex.pl - generate an image for a DEC station address (etherNet MAC
  address) 32x8 PROM as used on the DELUA/DEUNA cards and various VAX boards
  (eg, VS4000VLC). Not part of this flow, but a useful program so I included it.

o genrom - a /bin/sh script to assemble/generate/check a boot/console PROM

o run - a simple /bin/sh script that runs genrom in each subdirectory

For the perl scripts, perl 5.8 or later is recommended. To get a man page for
any of these perl scripts try:  ./file.pl --help
